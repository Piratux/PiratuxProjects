Elevators:

- Get an input of a list of number pairs
(must be different and within a set range)
eg. [[1,5],[3,7],[7,6],[4,1]]
- Consider the numbers as floors in a building.
- Given a starting level of an elevator and the 
list of numbers mentioned, calculate the quickest 
route so that nobody has to wait longer than 
they have to.
- The first number in each pair in the list 
indicates the starting floor of a passenger and 
the last, the end.
